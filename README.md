# omx-foscam-startup
omx player script to start a stream from foscam surveillance camera on raspberry

I used this script to start omx player on startup of a raspberry.
The reason to use this player was that it can use raspberryÂ´s hardware decoding capabilities.
60 seconds timeout is to give time for network initialization.
